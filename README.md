# Improved UX for UITextField
Due to space constraints, a lot of mobile apps use the placeholder of the UITextField to label what the text field represents. But once the user starts typing, the placeholder is no longer available and its difficult for the user to know what field they are typing in or they have typed in.<br/><br/>
This UI component improves the UX in the following ways - 
- Transitions the placeholders into floating labels when user is editing a text field or has entered a value in it
- Animates and highlights the currently edited text field to make it explicit to users which field their cursor is currently active on
